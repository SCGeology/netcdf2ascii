# netcdfToASCII
Python scripts written for ArcPy to convert netCDF files of metdata and daymet sources to ascii files needed for a USGS SWB groundwater recharge model. 

A toolbox was created for ArcGIS. The tools provide options for specifying the extent of analysis, resampling cell size, raster alignment, climate variables, and days of the year to extract from the netCDF files. 

Two separate scripts were developed, one for MetData source and one for Daymet source. 

You can download the toolboxes (along with scripts and folder structure) with the .7z files. 

[The wiki for this project](https://github.com/SCGeology/netcdf2ascii/wiki/Convert-NetCDF-to-ASCII) shows the tool help generated in ArcGIS. It can give you context while you look at the code.
