# netcdfToASCII
Python scripts written for ArcPy to convert netCDF files of metdata and daymet sources to ascii files needed for a USGS SWB groundwater recharge model. 

A toolbox was created for ArcGIS. The tools provide options for specifying the extent of analysis, resampling cell size, raster alignment, climate variables, and days of the year to extract from the netCDF files. 

Two separate scripts were developed, one for MetData source and one for Daymet source.
